# ♟️Chess

A C++ chess game using raylib for rendering — a simple, lightweight implementation of Chess that you can build and run locally.

## 🚀 Features

- Full chessboard rendering and piece movement  
- Built in C++ for performance and portability  
- Uses raylib for graphics — easy to compile and run on multiple platforms  
- Simple, minimalistic visuals and straightforward gameplay  

## 🛠️ Installation & Build Instructions

1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JakePriestman/Chess.git

    Open the solution file Chess.sln in Visual Studio (or load the project in your preferred C++ IDE).

    Build the project.

    After building, move the generated .exe file to the project folder — this is required so that the game can successfully locate its asset files (e.g. textures, graphics, etc.).

    Run the .exe and enjoy the game.

    💡 Note: Ensure you have raylib installed (and linked properly) if your environment requires manual setup.

🎮 Usage / Example

    Launch the game → you should see a rendered chessboard.

    Move pieces using mouse/keyboard (or as defined in controls).

    Basic chess rules are implemented (e.g. legal moves, capturing).

    You can restart or close the game via the UI / window controls.
